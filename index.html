        <h1>Why rooks were made to be sacrificed</h1>
        <h2>P.S I like the word rank and ROOK</h2>
        This is my very first website and I'm <b> GOING TO SACRIFICE THE ROOK!!!!!!!!</b>                   

        <p><I>Rooks</I> were made to be sacrificed, they go foward and back and<b> THEY SOUND COOL!!!!!!</b></p>
        <p>Rooks are a chess piece located on the 1st and 8th file, they move fowards, backwards, left, and right. 
            Rooks have a <strong>special</strong> move in which the rook and king hasn't moved and the knight and bishop are out of the way, this is called castling and is a top priority in most games
            Rooks are meant to be castles (as indicated by castling)
            <br> are typically middle game pieces, since they are the hardest to move in the openening
            <hr>
            During the middle game the <u>rook</u> should be castled or slided over to an open file
            Rooks become insanely important during the endgame which the most common checkmates in the endgame are either with the queen,rook, or 2 rooks
        Rooks should be sacrificed because it <em>leads</em> to a forced mate and rooks are special. </p>
